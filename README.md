# PigeonHeadToken
This is about a decentralized NFT market place project
"PigeonHead" will be the currency used on the market place
The users will be able to list digital assets, buy other's users listed assets and place bids
Preregistered users will receive an airdrop in their "pigeon wallet" like two weeks before the platform deployment
They will be able to refeer others potential users and earn additional PH(pigeon head) according to the number of people that join the platform using their link

I am building the platform by myself using these technologies(this list can and will be updated in the future):
-NodeJS runtime
-Express
-BodyParser
-IPFS
-IPFS-HTTP-CLIENT
-TAILWIND
